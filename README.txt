Deep Learning AI Project for College Vault™ Logo Classification
v0.8.0 - beta

Kirsten Dusterhoft

This project aims to create a CNN for the purpose of classifying College Vault™ logos
First iteration is going to be a proof of concept for Michigan College Vault™ logos
Upon proof of concept, expand to other College Vault™ schools

Includes Web Scraper for Image Gathering
To use: include a file in the folder named data.csv which has a single column of skus with the column header "Name"
-Note: column header is case sensitive, Netsuite should export with the column called Name but double check if not working
